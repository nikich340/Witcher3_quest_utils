HOWTO create a new empty project
---------------------------------

0. copy the content of the template.project folder into a new directory

1. rename _settings_.bat-template to _settings_.bat

2. adjust the MODNAME, idspace and DIR_* settings in the _settings_.bat

3. run _createLinks_.bat ONCE to connect project with modkit r4data

4. create a new empty project with questgraph editor and save it in the
   definition.quest folder

5. manually adjust the production settings in the created
   prod.quest-newquestproject.yml (in definition.quest folder) to match the
   ones in _settings_.bat

6. (optional) rename prod.quest-newquestproject.yml according to your chosen MODNAME

7. (optional) rename the MODNAME.speech.csv.template custom voiceline strings file
   in speech folder to "mod<MODNAME>.speech.csv" according to your MODNAME setting.
   This will ensure these strings will also be included automatically into the
   encoded strings file.
